# hl7-fhir-udap-common

## Overview

This is nodejs library that is part of a 4 repo collection for a full [UDAP](https://www.udap.org/) implementation.   The implementation adheres to the published [HL7 UDAP Security Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-udap-security-ig/).   The methods in this library are methods that will be used by both a UDAP Server and a UDAP Client.  The methods provide functionality that supports dealing with UDAP JWT's (creating and verifying), dealing with Trust Community Certificates (parsing, for signing keys, validating certficate chains, CRL and expiration).

## Usage
